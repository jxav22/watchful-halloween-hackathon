- Real-time "Syncing" indicator
- Large preview area on the right
- "Generate my Story" button

**2. Loading Page - "Generating your book"**
- Step-by-step progress indicators
- 7 generation steps with animated checkmarks
- Spinning loader for current step
- "Send me a email" button
- Auto-advances through steps

**3. Output Page - "Book output"**

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### New Components
```
frontend/components/
├── LandingPage.tsx      # Book curation form
├── LoadingPage.tsx      # Generation progress
└── OutputPage.tsx       # Book display
```

#### Updated Files
- `app/page.tsx` - State management for page transitions
- `app/globals.css` - Dark purple theme
- `types/index.ts` - New TypeScript types for book generation
- `app/api/generate/route.ts` - API endpoint for book generation

#### State Flow
```
Landing Page → Loading Page → Output Page
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  (Input)      (Processing)   (Display)
                                  ↓
                            (Back button)
```

### 🎯 Key Features

1. **Smooth Transitions**: Pages transition seamlessly through states
2. **Progress Feedback**: Users see exactly what's happening during generation
3. **Dark Theme**: Consistent dark purple theme throughout
4. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
5. **Mock Data**: Includes mock data for testing without backend

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter book title, age range, and story
2. **Generation**: Click "Generate my Story" to start
3. **Processing**: Watch the progress through 7 steps
4. **Output**: View the generated book pages
5. **Restart**: Click "Back" to create another book

### 🔌 Backend Integration

The API endpoint is ready at `/api/generate`:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "title": "My Spooky Adventure",
  "ageRange": 7,
  "story": "Once upon a time..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bookId": "book-123",
  "book": {
    "id": "book-123",
    "title": "My Spooky Adventure",
    "ageRange": 7,
    "pages": [...],
    "generatedAt": "2025-11-01T..."
  }
}
```

### 📝 What's Next

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls
2. **Image Generation**: Add AI-generated images for book pages
3. **Email Function**: Implement "Send me a email" feature
4. **Save/Export**: Add ability to download or save books
